    "- How does the object look relative to the environment? eg. Will object be contrasted against a green/blue screen. A bright blob on dull background can very well be tracked with color as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much of motion is expected? Will the object change in scale and/or rotate? Template matching is not scale invariant, but SURF/SIFT is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How fast does it need to run, what's your quality vs speed trade-off (C++ vs Python language) ???\n",

    "#### Select feature descriptors to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide whether to use one or a variety of feature descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maybe try different individual or a combination of detectors if speed is not a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the user to select up to 3 objects in frame 1 of the video, then detect and track starting from frame 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A global find method is required which searches the whole frame, possibly from more than one scale when starting up or after object disappears.\n",
    "- Another method searches within a smaller region while tracking. \n",
    "- A gating method that tells whether find was a success."
